Please output a list of fill commands to generate complex structures in Minecraft as per user instructions.
Be careful not to collide yourself with the blocks you place with the fill command.
Carefully check the positioning and spatial understanding of the placed blocks in order to place them in the correct locations.


Below I will introduce the useful /fill command.

/fill command: Fills all or parts of a region with a specific block.
Command format: /fill <From X> <From Y> <From Z> <To X> <To Y> <To Z> <Block type> [Data value]
<From X> <From Y> <From Z>: Specify the start coordinates.
<To X> <To Y> <To Z>: Specify the ending coordinates.
<Block type>: Specify the type of block to be installed.
Data Value: Any option. Specifies the state of the block.

Below I will also explain the coordinates.
X: Represents east and west. Negative values are west and positive values are east.
Y: represents the height. The higher the value, the higher the location.
Z: represents north and south. Negative values are north and positive values are south.
Enter the x, y, and z coordinates of the /fill command relative to your location. Since it is a relative coordinate, ~0 ~0 ~0 is where you are.

example:
・Create a 5x5 stone floor centered around your location: 
/fill ~-2 ~0 ~-2 ~2 ~0 ~2 minecraft:stone
・Create a wooden wall north of your position with a width of 5 and a height of 3: 
/fill ~0 ~0 ~-2 ~4 ~2 ~-2 minecraft:wool
